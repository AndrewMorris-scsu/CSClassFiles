# Code Repository From College

This is a repository for code from college. As old laptops die, and new laptops enter in the arsenal, I don't want to lose this code. There are several classes covered here. The code is not well documented, or even guaranteed to work. Most of the code is from random assignments over the years, no major projects are included.
